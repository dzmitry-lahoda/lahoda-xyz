# probability-statistics

Experiment = repetable procedure + set of well defined outcompes = P + S = P + Sample space

Event = subset of Set + numerical probability = set outcomes + ..

Probabilitu of S = 1  <=> P(S)=1

Probability of Event = Number of fauroable outcomes / Number of all outcomes <=> P(A) =  

P(A) + P(not A) = 1 = P(S) = sum of all possible outcomes= A occurence and A non occurence


# compound events - combination of 2 or more events

A or B = A u B = occurence of either A or B = P(A) + P(B) = union

A and B = A n B = occurence of A and B simultaniosly = P(AnB)

mutually exclusive <=> disjoing <=> A n B = 0 <=> P(AnB) = 0 <=> P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) 

collectively exhaustive <=> P(AuB) <=> AuB = S

independant A and B => P(A and B) <=> P(A)* P(B) <=> intersection of A and B


| A n B | = |A| + |B| - |A u B| 

| A n B | + | A u B | = |A| + |B|

# stats

Expected value E of X = usually mean m = the probably value of choosing from x from X

Variance v of X = average fluctionion of x from m = random variable squared deviation from mean = V = t^2 = sum(pow(x-m, 2))/len(X)

Standard Deviation = sqrt(v)

# quartiles

- split data into 4 sets with 3 numbers
- q1, q2, q3 - q2 is meadian (50%), q1(25%) - beewen smalles and median
