# Errata for 2nd Edition

Many errors were fixed in preparation of the 2nd edition, but thanks in part to the careful reading by students and instructors, more have been revealed.  Over Summer 2017, I corrected many of these errors and released a corrected 2nd edition in time for Fall 2017.  The corrected edition is marked as such on the copyright page and back cover, and is the version that is available in html.

Moving forward, as errors are found, I will record them below.

## Errors not yet corrected

### Major errors

(updated 11/27/2017)

Page numbers match print and tablet pdf edition.

* Example 1.3.5-2 (page 67): the answer is 2162160, not 2192190.

* Exercise 1.5.4-c (page 88): the problem should require x, y, and z all be greater than *or equal* to -3.

* Page 147, last line: the sequence of F's and T's is off near the end.  The correct sequence is F, F, F, F, T, F, F, T, F, T, F, F, T,...


### Minor typos

* Page 200, after the definition of a graph, the example has *five* edges, not four.


## Errors Corrected Summer 2017

In case you have a copy of the book printed prior to July 2017, you will find the following errors that have since been corrected.  Typos are not included below, unless they might cause confusion.

* Exercise 0.4.5(d) (page 38): the piecewise definition is missing *n* (should read, "if *n* is even/if *n* is odd").

* Exercise 0.4.13 (page 39): the piecewise definition is missing *n*.

* Exercise 1.1.5 solution (page 279): parts (a) and (b) were backwards.
* Example 1.3.4 (page 66): The codomain should have 8 elements in it.

* Exercise 1.4.6 was missing a part before part (a): the first part should ask for the number of strings starting with 1.  The answers were off, because of this.

* Exercise 2.1.5 (page 119): The recurrence relation should be a_n = 7a_{n-1} - 10a_{n-2}.

* Definition of Subgraphs (page 204): The indices were swapped making the definition of induced subgraph incorrect.  The following example was also reworded to account for the correction.


* Exercise 2.2.1(f) solution (page 294): The closed formula is wrong.  it should be 1+(4n+6)n/2.

* Examples 2.2.6 and 2.3.1-1: both of these start with the wrong sequence, which should be 2, 3, 7, 14, 24, 37,..., to match the solution given.

* Exercise 2.3.1(b) solution (page 296): the formula should be a_n = n^2 + n.

* Exercise 2.4.8 (page 146): The second term should be \beta a_{n-2}.

* Exercise 4.1.4 (page 206): In graph 1, the last edge should be {c,d} and not {c,e} (otherwise, the answer in the back is wrong).

* Exercise 4.1.6 solution (page 311): The middle graph was labeled incorrectly.

* Exercise 4.2.3 (page 218) and its solution (page 312): This problem is broken.  As stated, there is no polyhedron that satisfies the statement of the problem.  One way to fix it: assume the polyhedron has 11 vertices including those around the mystery face.
