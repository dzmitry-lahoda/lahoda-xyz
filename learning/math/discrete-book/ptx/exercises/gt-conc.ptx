        You might want to give the proof in two parts.  First prove by induction that the cycle <m>C_n</m> has <m>v=e</m>.  Then consider what happens if the graph is more than just the cycle.

              Conjecture a relationship between a tree graph's vertices and edges. (For instance,

              Prove your conjecture from part (a) by induction on the number of vertices.
