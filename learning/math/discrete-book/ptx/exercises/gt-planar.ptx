    <statement>
      <p permid="kcI">
        Is it possible for a planar graph to have 6 vertices, 10 edges and 5 faces?
        Explain.

    </statement>
    <solution permid="jsO">
      <p permid="VZd">
        No.
        A (connected) planar graph must satisfy Euler's formula:
        <m>v - e + f = 2</m>.
        Here <m>v - e + f = 6 - 10 + 5 = 1</m>.

    <statement>
      <p permid="QjR">
        The graph <m>G</m> has 6 vertices with degrees <m>2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5</m>.
        How many edges does <m>G</m> have?
        Could <m>G</m> be planar?
        If so, how many faces would it have.
        If not, explain.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution permid="PzX">
      <p permid="Cgm">
        <m>G</m> has 10 edges, since <m>10 = \frac{2+2+3+4+4+5}{2}</m>.
        It could be planar,
        and then it would have 6 faces, using Euler's formula:
        <m>6-10+f = 2</m> means <m>f = 6</m>.
        To make sure that it is actually planar though,
        we would need to draw a graph with those vertex degrees without edges crossing.
        This can be done by trial and error
        (and is possible).

        I'm thinking of a polyhedron containing 12 faces.
        Seven are triangles and four are quadralaterals.
        The polyhedron has 11 vertices including those around the mystery face.
        How many sides does the last face have?

<!-- I should check that this is actually possible as a polyhedron -->

      <p permid="inv">
        Say the last polyhedron has <m>n</m> edges,
        and also <m>n</m> vertices.
        The total number of edges the polyhedron has then is <m>(7 \cdot 3 + 4 \cdot 4 + n)/2 = (37 + n)/2</m>.
        In particular,
        we know the last face must have an odd number of edges.
        We also have that <m> v = 11 </m>.
        By Euler's formula, we have <m>11 - (37+n)/2 + 12 = 2</m>,
        and solving for <m>n</m> we get <m>n = 5</m>,
        so the last face is a pentagon.

        Prove Euler's formula using induction on the number of edges in the graph.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution permid="ocH">

      <proof permid="UjQ">
        <p permid="OuE">
          Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement,
          <q>every connected planar graph containing <m>n</m> edges satisfies <m>v - n + f = 2</m>.</q>
          We will show <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 0</m>.
        </p>
        
        <p permid="uBN">
			       Base case: there is only one graph with zero edges, namely a single isolated vertex. In this case <m>v = 1</m>, <m>f = 1</m> and <m>e = 0</m>, so Euler's formula holds.
        </p>
    
        <p permid="aIW">
			     Inductive case: Suppose <m>P(k)</m> is true for some arbitrary <m>k \ge 0</m>. Now consider an arbitrary graph containing <m>k+1</m> edges (and <m>v</m> vertices and <m>f</m> faces). No matter what this graph looks like, we can remove a single edge to get a graph with <m>k</m> edges which we can apply the inductive hypothesis to.
        </p>
        
        <p permid="GQf">
           There are two cases: either the graph contains a cycle or it does not. If the graph contains a cycle, then pick an edge that is part of this cycle, and remove it.  This will not disconnect the graph, and will decrease the number of faces by 1 (since the edge was bordering two distinct faces).  So by the inductive hypothesis we will have <m>v - k + f-1 = 2</m>. Adding the edge back will give <m>v - (k+1) + f = 2</m> as needed.
        </p>
        
        <p permid="mXo">   
           If the graph does not contain a cycle, then it is a tree, so has a vertex of degree 1.  Then we can pick the edge to remove to be incident to such a degree 1 vertex. In this case, also remove that vertex. The smaller graph will now satisfy <m>v-1 - k + f = 2</m> by the induction hypothesis (removing the edge and vertex did not reduce the number of faces). Adding the edge and vertex back gives <m>v - (k+1) + f = 2</m>, as required.

          Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, Euler's formula holds for all planar graphs.
