              This must be the degree sequence for a tree.
              This is because the vertex of degree 4 must be adjacent to the four vertices of degree 1
              (there are no other vertices for it to be adjacent to),
              and thus we get a star.

              Each degree 3 vertex is adjacent to all but one of the vertices in the graph.
              Thus each must be adjacent to one of the degree 1 vertices
              (and not the other).
              That means both degree 3 vertices are adjacent to the degree 2 vertex,
              and to each other,
