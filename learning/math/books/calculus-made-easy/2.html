<h1><br>On Different Degrees of Smallness</h1>
<p class="a rotatedFloralHeartBullet">

<p>We shall find that in our processes of calculation we
have to deal with small quantities of various degrees
of smallness.

<p>We shall have also to learn under what circumstances
we may consider small quantities to be so minute
that we may omit them from consideration. Everything
depends upon relative minuteness.

<p>Before we fix any rules let us think of some
familiar cases. There are $60$ minutes in the hour,
$24$ hours in the day, $7$ days in the week. There are
therefore $1440$ minutes in the day and $10080$ minutes
in the week.

<p>Obviously $1$ minute is a very small quantity of
time compared with a whole week. Indeed, our
forefathers considered it small as compared with an

hour, and called it “one minùte,” meaning a minute
fraction–namely one sixtieth–of an hour. When
they came to require still smaller subdivisions of time,
they divided each minute into $60$ still smaller parts,
which, in Queen Elizabeth's days, they called “second
minùtes” (<em>i.e.:</em> small quantities of the second order of
minuteness). Nowadays we call these small quantities

of the second order of smallness “seconds.” But few
people know <em>why</em> they are so called.

<p>Now if one minute is so small as compared with a
whole day, how much smaller by comparison is one
second!

<p>Again, think of a farthing as compared with a
sovereign: it is barely worth more than $\frac{1}{1000}$ part.
A farthing more or less is of precious little importance
compared with a sovereign: it may certainly be regarded
as a <em>small</em> quantity. But compare a farthing
with £$1000$: relatively to this greater sum, the
farthing is of no more importance than $\frac{1}{1000}$ of a
farthing would be to a sovereign. Even a golden
sovereign is relatively a negligible quantity in the
wealth of a millionaire.

<p>Now if we fix upon any numerical fraction as
constituting the proportion which for any purpose
we call relatively small, we can easily state other
fractions of a higher degree of smallness. Thus if,
for the purpose of time, $\frac{1}{60}$ be called a <em>small</em> fraction,
then $\frac{1}{60}$ of $\frac{1}{60}$ (being a <em>small</em> fraction of a <em>small</em>
fraction) may be regarded as a <em>small quantity of the
second order</em><a name="smallness"/> of smallness.*
<p><note>*The mathematicians talk about the second order of “magnitude”
  (<em>i.e.:</em> greatness) when they really mean second order of <em>smallness</em>.
  This is very confusing to beginners.</note>

<p>Or, if for any purpose we were to take $1$ per cent. (<em>i.e.:</em> $\frac{1}{100}$) as a <em>small</em> fraction, then $1$ per cent. of
$1$ per cent. (<em>i.e.:</em> $\frac{1}{10,000}$) would be a small fraction
of the second order of smallness; and $\frac{1}{1,000,000}$ would

be a small fraction of the third order of smallness,
being $1$ per cent. of $1$ per cent. of $1$ per cent.

<p>Lastly, suppose that for some very precise purpose
we should regard $\frac{1}{1,000,000}$ as “small.” Thus, if a
first-rate chronometer is not to lose or gain more than
half a minute in a year, it must keep time with an
accuracy of $1$ part in $1,051,200$. Now if, for such a
purpose, we regard $\frac{1}{1,000,000}$ (or one millionth) as a
small quantity, then $\frac{1}{1,000,000}$ of $\frac{1}{1,000,000}$, that is
$\frac{1}{1,000,000,000,000}$ (or one billionth) will be a small
quantity of the second order of smallness, and may
be utterly disregarded, by comparison.

<p>Then we see that the smaller a small quantity itself
is, the more negligible does the corresponding small
quantity of the second order become. Hence we
know that <em>in all cases we are justified in neglecting
the small quantities of the second–or third (or
higher)–orders</em>, if only we take the small quantity
of the first order small enough in itself.

<p>But, it must be remembered, that small quantities
if they occur in our expressions as factors multiplied
by some other factor, may become important if the
other factor is itself large. Even a farthing becomes
important if only it is multiplied by a few hundred.

<p>Now in the calculus we write $dx$ for a little bit
of $x$. These things such as $dx$, and $du$, and $dy$, are
called “differentials,” the differential of $x$, or of $u$,
or of $y$, as the case may be. [You <em>read</em> them as
<em>dee-eks</em>, or <em>dee-you</em>, or <em>dee-wy</em>.] If $dx$ be a small bit
of $x$, and relatively small of itself, it does not follow
that such quantities as $x · dx$, or $x^2\, dx$, or $a^x\, dx$ are
negligible. But $dx × dx$ would be negligible, being a
small quantity of the second order.

<p>A very simple example will serve as illustration.

<p>Let us think of $x$ as a quantity that can grow by
a small amount so as to become $x + dx$, where $dx$ is
the small increment added by growth. The square
of this is $x^2 + 2x · dx + (dx)^2$. The second term is
not negligible because it is a first-order quantity;
while the third term is of the second order of smallness,
being a bit of,
a bit of $x^2$. Thus if we took
$dx$ to mean numerically, say, $\frac{1}{60}$ of $x$, then the second
term would be $\frac{2}{60}$ of $x^2$, whereas the third term would
be $\frac{1}{3600}$ of $x^2$. This last term is clearly less important
than the second. But if we go further and take
$dx$ to mean only $\frac{1}{1000}$ of $x$, then the second term
will be $\frac{2}{1000}$ of $x^2$, while the third term will be
only $\frac{1}{1,000,000}$ of $x^2$.

<p>Geometrically this may be depicted as follows:
Draw a square (<a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>) the side of which we will
take to represent $x$. Now suppose the square to
grow by having a bit $dx$ added to its size each
way. The enlarged square is made up of the original
square $x^2$, the two rectangles at the top and on the
right, each of which is of area $x · dx$ (or together
$2x · dx$), and the little square at the top right-hand
corner which is $(dx)^2$. In <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a> we have taken $dx$ as
quite a big fraction of $x$–about $\frac{1}{5}$. But suppose we
had taken it only $\frac{1}{100}$–about the thickness of an
inked line drawn with a fine pen. Then the little
corner square will have an area of only $\frac{1}{10,000}$ of $x^2$,
and be practically invisible. Clearly $(dx)^2$ is negligible
if only we consider the increment $dx$ to be itself
small enough.

<p>Let us consider a simile.

<p>Suppose a millionaire were to say to his secretary:
next week I will give you a small fraction of any
money that comes in to me. Suppose that the
secretary were to say to his boy: I will give you a
small fraction of what I get. Suppose the fraction
in each case to be $\frac{1}{100}$ part. Now if Mr. Millionaire
received during the next week £$1000$, the secretary

would receive £$10$ and the boy $2$ shillings. Ten
pounds would be a small quantity compared with
£$1000$; but two shillings is a small small quantity
indeed, of a very secondary order. But what would
be the disproportion if the fraction, instead of being $\frac{1}{100}$,
had been settled at $\frac{1}{1000}$ part? Then, while
Mr. Millionaire got his £$1000$, Mr. Secretary would
get only £$1$, and the boy less than one farthing!

<p>The witty Dean Swift*
once wrote:
<blockquote><pre>
So, Nat'ralists observe, a Flea
Hath smaller Fleas that on him prey.
And these have smaller Fleas to bite 'em,
And so proceed ad infinitum." </pre>
</blockquote>
  <p><note><em>*On Poetry: a Rhapsody</em> (p. 20), printed 1733–usually misquoted.</note>

<p>An ox might worry about a flea of ordinary
size–a small creature of the first order of smallness.
But he would probably not trouble himself about a
flea's flea; being of the second order of smallness, it
would be negligible. Even a gross of fleas' fleas
would not be of much account to the ox.
