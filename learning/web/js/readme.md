I learn pure JavaScript language without regarding  web environment or any libraries/frameworks.

Naming and comments use terminology for JavaScript features from modern academics and latest rich statically typed languages rather then JavaScript slang if possible.

Prototyping is automatic delegation in class based statically typing OOP world. May be realized via codegeneration.


`console.log(a === b);` is used as assertion

Modify  `config.js` with your absolute paths and run to setup environment for some tests.
