I learn various Web technologies, beneath and above.
====================================================


I experiment with pure web technologies:

- no pure JavaScript language related things
- by default all things are strict, statically typed and explicitly defined as possible in frames of standards
- when dynamism is used then stated explicitly about
- latest standards are used and backported to older if needed
- not usage of non pure web (like  transcompilers into JS or compilers or minimizers), until tools are very very mature and standart
- all HTML tags are small cased and closed until experimenting with HTML parsing
- global state avoided as much as possible everywhere in JS
- not using all in one frameworks, but `peace meal` libraries
- using not minimized full texts libraries, until specifically tested minimization
- elements layouts and responsivenes
