Random walk is discrete markov process with expected value:

```math
0 + \sum_{T} \ {p (+1) + (1 - p)  (-1)}
```

with p being uniformly distirbuted.

if `p = 0.5` then `0`.


Martingale process is magrovina with $E[X_T|X_t=x] = x$, 

Random walk can be Wienr process if time increments go to zero.

Wiener process.

Wiener process with drift.
