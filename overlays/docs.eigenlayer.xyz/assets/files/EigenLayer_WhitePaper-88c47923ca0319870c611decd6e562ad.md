EigenLayer(EL) is set of smart contracts on Ethereum(E).

Allows to validate modules built on top E.

Stakers(S) grand slashing permissions to EL on staked amount.

Actively Validating Service(AVS) A bring proofs outside of consensus.

Core flow is:

1. Validator V delegate staking to EL
2. V gets S token
3. V allocates to set of modules M
4. V runs A for each module it allocated
5. V is slashed in case of misbehave
