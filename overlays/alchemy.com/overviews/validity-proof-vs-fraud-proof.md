Optimistic:
- assume all transactions are correct
- use fraid proofs within period
- faurd cancel all transactions after fraud verified
- fraud proof can be given only during dispute period
- single(all runs in EVM) vs multi(intractive) rounds

ZK rollup:
- instant validity
- SNARK scalable (linear) but need trusted setup
- STARK sub linear and setup on public verifiable randomness

ZK has prover and verifier. prover produces witness to verify.

There is some difference of offchain vs on chain data, so not clearly described.
