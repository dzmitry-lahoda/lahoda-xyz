# Binary opeator

It tells about `binary operators`.

Let `*` - to be binary operator.

`*: G x G -> G` <- tells that binary operator combines 2 elements from G set to one element from G.

Set can be `closed` under binary operator , if operator applied to set produces element from same set.


# Group (G,*)

Is set `G` with `*` is called `group` if it is `closed`, `associative`(with `identity` and `inverse`).

## Abelian

If `commutative``


## Group Homomorphism



G, *
H, x

mapping f : G -> H if 

$$
f(x * y) = f(x) \cdot f(y)
$$


if $e_G$ then $ \phi(e_G) = e_H $

if $ a^{-1} in G  => \phi(a^{-1}) = \phi(a)^{-1} $  in H  


### Isomorphism

If homomorphism is bijection

Writing Proofs | Contrapositive

### Endomorphism

Is group homomorphism to itself

### Automorphism

Iso to self


### Subgroup

$H \subseteq (G, \cdot)$ and H is closed under $\cdot$ then it is group and subgroup of G

Each element of  subgroup H is element of group G $H \leq G$.

H is group closed to same binary operation as G.

Inverses and identity elements of group and subgroup are same

Order of group G is number elements in group is $|G|$.

Order of element: 

$|a| = { n : n = min(1..n) a^n = e_G } $


If $a^k=e_G <=>  n | k  $ 

## Lagrange theorem

$G$ is finite.

$H \leq G \Rightarrow |H| | |G|$

Size of subgroup divides size of group


$a \in G => |a| | |G|$

$|H| = d$ and $|G| = n$, there is exactly one subgroup of order $n/d$, consisting of multiples of $d$.  

## Cyclic groups


Contains all elements which can be generated by single element $a$

so that $a^{(n+1)} = a^n * a$ 

$\langle a \rangle = { ... , a^-2, a^-1, e_g, a^1, a^2, ... }$

Every cyclic group is Abelian.

Inverse of generator is generator of same group.

Every subgroup of cyclic group is cyclic.

If n = |G|, and d | n => exists | H | = d where H = < a ^ n/d >
