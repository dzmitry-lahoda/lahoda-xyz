# Overview

Shows that congruence is equivalence relation defining residue classes.

Shows properties of addition and multiplication of residue classes.



Z_n is residue class

a^ and b^ are representatives of residue class of some n e Z. 

so a^ + b^ = (a + nZ) + (b+nZ) = (a+b) + nZ = (a+b)^

**Example**

1^ = 12 mod 11
2^ = 2 mod 11

(12 + 2) mod 11  = 14 mod 11 = 3

1^ + 2^ = 3^
