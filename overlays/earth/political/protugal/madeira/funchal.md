Dirty noisy smelly toursit trap place 
with a lot of bad poison food, vagabonds, rude drivers and fumating cars.

Drivers think of people walking by foot as plebs,
very rude, do not know rules of drivign and parking,
and blame you for their violations.


Has couple of good places so and some good people keeping these, on foot.
Rest only by car.
