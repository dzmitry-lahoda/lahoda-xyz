WBT has $Gamma$ and $Alpha$ parameters.

$Alpha$ decides if rotation to be made at all.

$Gamma$ decides if do single or double rotation.

Ideal parameters are irrational, 

specifically

$<Alpha, Gamma>= < 1 + sqrt(2), sqrt(2)> $

there are afficient integer paramters to use,

which are and can only be 

$<Alpha, Gamma> = <3, 2>$
