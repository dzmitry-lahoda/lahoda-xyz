= Overview

Integrative writing for internet.

== Overlaying

Do not categorize. Follow the source location. 

So your categories are just overlays.

In case of category is new write here, until solid category arises.

Strong pro overlay heuristic is that overlay is what essectiary you want to be merged to source.
For example addition to Wikipedia are such.

Overlay is what you want to be on targer or what AI agent you wanted to teach you.

=== Overlaying and duplicaiton

Overlyas about sources of datum.

So data is about single entity, entity may prefix source.

Intermediatery is not source. 
For example good seller is source, not financial system it was communicated through.
Banks are rate limited metered chats. 

Also datum may be used for temporal project, limited in item.
In this case project gets hard link for overlying.
Project arhieved into p2p content addresable storage.

**Example**

`my-son/earht/portugal/lisbon/the-school.pdf`
`projects/residence/the-school #2025.pdf`
`projects/irs-2025/the-school #2025.pdf`

=== And privay

- personal (if shared, then locally encrypt)
- to near
- to services
- to all public

=== Duplication and retentio

- automatic folders like Downloads or Scrheeshots or DCIM are temporal. Can be history deleted.

== Leaf

Write single leaf name as if it can be folder name.

So later make it folder with root file and other files.

== Tags

Tags are add orthogonal to categorization. 
So sometimes being overlayed for some category will induce some tags but make some irrelevant.

== What if overlay has nonsensical symbols in path?

Retain it.

== What if underlying disappears or rebuilds its navigation?

I do not see problem with that. There is webmachine or you have uploaded original as PDF into IPFS.
