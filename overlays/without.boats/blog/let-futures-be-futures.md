- rust creates stack allocated machine per task
- root future owned by executor is task
- futures are polled by executor
- there are multi thread, multi task, intra task concurrency
- mutex hold over state transtion can deadlock
- continuation passing style (callback) and future calls next future rejected as require allocation or multi ownership of callback
- then it dicussed desing of async and sync libraries, from which i conclude - libraries are just different.
- also references stackfull and stackless coroutines, but that is more reading needed
