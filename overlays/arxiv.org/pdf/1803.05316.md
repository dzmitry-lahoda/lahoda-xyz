Functions can be:

- order preserving
- metric preserving
- addiiton preserving

- Hasser diagram shows order preserving functions

- join can be dervied from order

- if function is lossy again than there are generative effects


If f(A)= X and F(B) = Y,
and if f(A) \/ (B) < f(A \/ B),
=> there is generative effect.
