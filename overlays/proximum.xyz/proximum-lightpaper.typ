In introduction it gives well grounded critiqu of PoS and PoW and traditional consensus.

PoS and location independed PoW - they tended to centralize.

Global conensuse makes latency big and not suitable to other heavently bodies, not they can scale that well.

USD pegged stable suffers from its fiat problem and BTC is not elastic enough to have stable price.

So we can define new PoW algorith, 
were choose rule of consensus is largers space-time occupied.
If weel like fully emepareacds split brain and merge.

Paper proposes proof of proximity.

Cryptographi message is sent from A to B, B appends its own message and sends back to A.
A runs VDF. This allows to limit higher bound of distance between A and B.

Running it many times and proving to others, and averaging via Kalman Filter allows to get best location bound,
