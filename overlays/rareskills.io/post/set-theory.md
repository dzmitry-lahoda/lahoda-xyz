Usual set theory. 

To recap some,

**Injective** - there is at most one preimage for element in codomain, it is to have zero preimages, having 2 or more for same element is not okey, like "<= 1"

**Surjective** - there is at least one preimage for element in codedomain, there can be serveral preimage for same element, but not zero. like ">=1".

$Bijective =Injective + Surjective$, like $>=1$ and $<=1$ is $=1$

Magma is just closed.

Semigroup is associative Magma.

Monoid is Semigroup with Idenity element

Group is Monoid with inverse for each element.

Abelian if commutative (not sensitive to order).
