# About 

Dzmitry Lahoda creates software since 2004. 

Dzmitry has C1/Advanced English.

He likes product/quality/lean/transparency/openness/effectiveness oriented approaches. Dzmitry really enjoys real-time collaboration via messaging in chats.

Dzmitry coded integration solutions, client-servers, actor system, threading, cloud, desktop, drivers, custom software frameworks, reusable libraries, real-time networks, blockchains, basic applied statistics.

Worked in many domains. Dzmitry did not yet code graphic-intensive solutions, databases or math heavy stuff. 

Computer user since 1993, write programs since 2004, code version control and automated tests since 2007, increasштп velocity by open-source since 2009, work in companies since 2010, self-learner since childhood, do [active learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning) and [incremental reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_reading).  Did generalized machine learning algorithms in 2010.

Dzmitry enjoys type systems and automated proves of any kind, and writing in English. He always finds how to improve coding at hand at different levels.

He learns applied mathematics in his free time.

Dzmitry likes texts,  helps distributed teams to deliver better results leading by example of doing agile lean documentation and knowledge sharing.

Recently he became [digital nomad](https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/447201982).
