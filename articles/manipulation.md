If I do A and get reaction of X, and do B and get reaction Y.
And when X and Y both true leads to contraction,
it is strong indicator of manipulation.

Also,
if you give A, B and C, and ask for Y after,
never get anything like Y, you are against manipulation.
Specifically if A + B + C >> Y, and counterparty has not -X at a moment provable.
