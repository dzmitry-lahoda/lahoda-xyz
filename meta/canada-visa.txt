
Immigrating to Canada

The things bellow you should be doing along with looking for a job and perhaps obtaining a visa for temporary stay in Canada for work. The process also works for folks who are already in Canada.

Express entry (https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry.html)
Manages 3 programs of which you are interested in Federal Skilled Worker.


Take the test to determine eligibility (you need the language test, and when I tried to enter  smth there for you, I also entered that Marina also took the test; I wonder if it says you are eligible if she does not take the test ) https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/come-canada-tool-immigration-express-entry.html (actually, they determine eligibility based on the following factors https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/federal-skilled-workers/six-selection-factors-federal-skilled-workers.html#education)

How they compute the points once you are in the pool
Comprehensive ranking system (they also have a tool to calculate yours). Sit down and see how many points you could get. I assumed that you will do smth like CLB 7 for the language test and that Marina also takes the language test and evaluates her degree. The total I got for you was 350 (which is lower than most recent nominations - the minimum was around 450). In that case you do need a job offer.

Summary: Evaluate your points to see your chances.  Asessment of diploma and langauge tests might take a while, so I would start working (or at least thinking about it) now.
You can apply without having a job offer and update it later in the system.


Provincial nomination

You can also seek a provincial nomination (I will only look at British Columbia) https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/provincial-nominees/works.html

However, you could also apply for Express Entry and specify the province, which could then nominate you from the pool (which essentially guarantees your selection)

(Look at it yourself! I only looked briefly and could be mistaken)
From what I gathered for BC programs you need to have a job offer. They have Tech Pilot https://www.welcomebc.ca/Immigrate-to-B-C/B-C-Provincial-Nominee-Program/BC-PNP-Tech-Pilot that allowed to have short term job offers (one year), but it sounds like it is only till June 2019 (but they can extend it). For other program called Express Entry BC (https://www.welcomebc.ca/Immigrate-to-B-C/BC-PNP-Express-Entry-B-C) you need a contract without the end date.

And the points you get go down as you age ðŸ˜‰
