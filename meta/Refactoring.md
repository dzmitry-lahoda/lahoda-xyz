# Your are bounded by language you use

Try out other programming language.

## Refactor out patterns (computational patterns, something very orthogonal). 

E.g. refactor out data flow, caching, quering, error handling and allow logic to use these.

## Refactor out semantics (put semantically different words into different texts).

Growings plans should not be in the same text as cooking.

## Refactor out enforcements via types.

Compiles means work. Fails to compile - read error and satisfy typing.


Preliminary list of article which outlines going from no tests to tests with backward compatible changes and benefits
---

1.  Virtualization, memory as file system, in memory database,immutable/version database, self hosting, CLR hooks, CLR fusion

2. Complexity, parallel tests, many tests.

3. Backward compatibility hook.
3.1 internal+internal visible to vs reflection vs Editor Browsable Never + XxxInternal + comment for internal use

4. Static constructors

5. Static methods

6. Singletons

7. Dependency injection.

8. Semantics

9. Devices reuse
