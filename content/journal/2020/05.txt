I got thought that I am not effective enough - I cannot integrate video into the game to show concerts.
 
What exactly happended? 

I was sitting at table with father and described him my work. 

Also I was overeating cottage cheese with pancake.

I felt anxiety onto 60 of 100.

I thought automatically - what I will be tasked each month with such a hard problem?

Or will face it and will need estimate? 

I really believed into it.

I felt back neck ache.

I really will need time to research. And already was tasked to do such research.

So I can settle that - discuss, ask for advice. Once I handle that - next time it will be easier.

But, it did it before already in some form. Alone and with guidance. 

Difference was in that it was not tasked as work item with some time limit.

Do I really have limit?

When I did alone, I got some output. But once it was research of average quality.

Another time overengineered bull of mud.

So realistically it depends on what is expected. But I got the way - I got to the point.

I got 35 of 100 of emotion and can handle beliefs.
